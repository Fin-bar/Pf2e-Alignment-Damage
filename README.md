# Pf2e-Alignment-Damage
A module for changing the automated behavior of aligned damage, enabling it to apply to more creatures

# Features

By default, allows aligned damage to affect all creatures lacking the corresponding trait,
e.g. Evil damage will affect Neutral creatures in addition to Good creatures.

Includes a toggle to allow aligned damage to affect *all* creatures without explicit immunity, 
e.g. Evil damage will affect Devils.
